\begin{resume}
 
  \section{SUMMARY} I'm a programmer with 15+ years of experience, mostly in Video Games. I like to define myself as a generalist developer, because I have a broad interest in many fields, and because of that, I can bring good problem solving skills that involve seeing the big picture and borrows from different domains within the realm of programming. Although most of my professional experience is in Gameplay and Audio, I'm very versatile with technologies and languages, but my main goals are systems, graphics and audio programming. Other interests: Functional Programming (Haskell and Lisp).
