\section{SUMMARY} I'm a Game Developer with 5+ years of experience in the field. I have worked on big projects here in Brazil for huge brands such as Samsung, Playboy, LG, and other own IPs such as Candypot and Finding Monsters Adventure. I'm a generalist developer, swinging from gameplay programming to server engineering.

I'm very versatile with technologies and languages, but my specialities are: Unity3D development with C\#; Flash AS3; Web Backend Development with PHP, Python and JavaScript. I'm currently very enthisiastic of functional programming with Haskell and Scala.
